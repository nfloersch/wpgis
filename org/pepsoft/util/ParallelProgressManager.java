/**
 * A manager of parallel progress receivers, which reports to one parent
 * progress receiver, combining the progress values and managing the reporting
 * of exceptions or task completion.
 * 
 * <ol><li>Instantiate it with a parent progress receiver, and a task count (if
 * known). <strong>Note:</strong> the parent progress receiver should be thread
 * safe and not make assumptions about which threads its methods will be invoked
 * from!
 * 
 * <li>Invoke createProgressReceiver() as many times as needed.
 * <strong>Note:</strong> if the manager has not been created with a task count
 * you cannot invoke this method any more after the first task has started!
 * 
 * <li>Start the tasks in background threads and invoke {@link #join()} on the
 * manager to wait for all tasks to complete (defined as either invoking
 * {@link ProgressReceiver#done()} or {@link ProgressReceiver#exceptionThrown(Throwable)}
 * on their progress receivers).</ol>
 *
 * <p>If a task invokes {@link ProgressReceiver#exceptionThrown(Throwable)} it will
 * be reported to the parent progress receiver, and all subsequent invocations
 * on their progress receivers by any other tasks will result in an
 * {@link ProgressReceiver.OperationCancelled} exception being thrown. If any
 * more exceptions are reported these are <em>not</em> reported to the parent
 * progress receiver (instead they are logged using the java.util logging
 * framework). Also, if an exception has been reported,
 * {@link ProgressReceiver#done()} will not subsequently be invoked on the
 * parent progress receiver.
 * 
 * <p>If no exceptions are reported, {@link ProgressReceiver#done()} will be
 * invoked on the parent progress receiver after the last task has invoked it on
 * its sub progress receiver.
 * 
 * <p>All invocations on {@link ProgressReceiver#setMessage(String)} are passed
 * through unaltered to the parent progress receiver.
 * 
 * <p>If the parent progress receiver throws an <code>OperationCancelled</code>
 * exception at any time, it is stored and rethrown to every task whenever they
 * next invoke a method (that declares it) on their sub progress receivers. It
 * is immediately rethrown to the calling task.
